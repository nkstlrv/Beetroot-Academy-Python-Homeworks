Here's what I'd say:\n\n The GR1 is pretty hard to beat. Mine is a 2013. I've rucked extensively with 2x 45lb plates in it, with and without hipbelt. One in the laptop compartment, one in the elastic pocket; just avoid bear crawls unless you ziptie the latter to the internal MOLLE. This GR1 was also my EDC for the better part of a decade. It's a little big for the modern office, but perfect if you're checking off multiple \"boxes\" (gym, etc) during your day. It's the ultimate do-it-all.\n\nThe GR2 2011 (40L, that's all they had then) was my first GR bag, and I used it in 4 challenges, a Scav, and Nasty. It's BIG; as in, it holds a LOT, but even on my 6'0\" 200lb frame, it's always been a big bag. I've traveled all over North America with it, planes/trains/automobiles, but it's best use (for me) honestly ended up being for my MMA training bag; all of the compartments keep gis, gloves, tape, nail clippers, change of clothes, disinfectant spray, extra contact lenses, flip flops, etc *really* we'll organized so you don't have to go searching.\n\nThe GR3 2020 is the bag *I* wished the GR2 was for travel. I prefer the single large compartment, and to use packing cubes to customize the layout I need for a specific trip's needs. It's a more adaptive format, provided you're willing to invest a little more in the extra organizing elements.\n\nThe Bullet 10L 2018 is pretty much just a day hiking bag for me. I'll throw it in another ruck when traveling and break it out as need be. Once it's got a hydration bladder in it, there's room for snacks, a jacket, bug spray, headlamp, but not much else.\n\nThe Bullet 15L laptop 2022 is a real game changer in the EDC department. It does everything the GR1 does in the way of office/MBA carry (laptop, extra monitor, cables, A4 notebook, pen/pencil/mouse bag, textbooks, etc) without looking like I'm *also* about to go summit a mountain.\n\nThe Rucker 4.0 25L 2023 is a fucking BEAST at its primary function. I load it up with anywhere between 45-100lbs depending on the days demands and it crushes. It came with the hipbelt and sternum strap standard, but can confirm the shoulder straps alone can handle large loads with ease. I've been incredibly impressed with the Vietnamese construction, and while I know some here hate on the new back panel fabric, I've found that a.) I'm not regularly dragging it behind a Humvee, b.) it doesn't hold \"stink\" as badly as the 1000D, and c.) The lumbar support is God for my frame (large ribcage/thoracic cavity, smaller hip structure for my size/weight).\n\nI hope the above helps. Personally I wouldn't want a Rucker as my do-it-all, because I think I'd find the plate pockets pretty annoying when they weren't serving their intended function, but obviously others here feel differently. It really depends on your use case scenarios. If you've got the need to buy *now*, GR1 26L or Rucker 25L (if you're going to be doing more EDC and hiking than rucking, I'd get a GR1. Reverse that, and I'd say get a Rucker). If it's travel you're concerned with, definitely go for your preference in the larger bags; just know they can be pretty conspicuous as an EDC when trying to shove under a desk or whatever. If you have patience and the budget for two bags, based on everything I've seen/read here, plus my experiences, I'd get the Long Range Rucker + 15L Bullet Laptop, when they're available, and cover all your bases.", "time": "2023-03-25 17:00:42"}, "Avelium": {"comment": "Sorry, not a military expert, just occasionally browsing FlightRadar :)  \nI remember seing this or similar Rivet Joint planes around Kaliningrad in Baltics, across border of Ukraine, in Barents Sea near Murmansk and Arkhangelsk Oblast, but never in Black Sea (there were only unmanned drones like downed recently Global Hawk).\n\nGuess it's not only for reconnaissance there but also as a political statement.

I know Zhalfir is powerful, but I don't buy that Zhaldfir is powerful enough to stop New Phyrexia's army. I am also struggling to grasp why most planes in the multiverse have not succumbed to Phyrexia's might. Mirrodin fell apart after Karn left some glistening oil behind: why are all these other planes so successful in their defenses? \n\nOverall part of me feels like I was duped into believing Phyrexia was as big of a threat to the multiverse as they implied in the first place.
