Here are some tips that might help you improve your application:\n\nExtracurricular Activities: Apart from your academic achievements, universities are also interested in students who have diverse interests and are involved in extracurricular activities. You can consider joining a computer science club, or volunteering for a technology-related nonprofit organization. You can also try building some projects on your own to showcase your programming skills.\n\nRecommendation Letters: Recommendation letters can play an important role in your application. Try to build strong relationships with your teachers and mentors who can write a good letter of recommendation for you.\n\nPersonal Statement: Your personal statement is an opportunity to showcase your personality, goals, and achievements. Be authentic and try to highlight why you are interested in pursuing computer science and how your experiences have prepared you for this field.\n\nResearch Universities: Research universities often have well-established computer science departments, with professors who are leaders in the field. Some top universities for computer science in the US include MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and UC Berkeley. In Canada, University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, and University of Waterloo are some good options.\n\nPrepare for Exams: In addition to TOEFL and SAT, you may also want to consider taking the ACT exam, which is another standardized test that is accepted by many universities. You can also consider taking subject tests in Math and Computer Science to showcase your skills in those areas.\n\nRemember, the application process can be competitive, so make sure to start preparing early and give yourself plenty of time to put together a strong application.
