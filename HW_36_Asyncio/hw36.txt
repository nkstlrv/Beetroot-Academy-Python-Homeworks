Task 1

Practice asynchronous code

Create a separate asynchronous code to calculate Fibonacci, factorial, squares and cubic for an input number.
Schedule the execution of this code using asyncio.gather for a list of integers from 1 to 10.
You need to get four lists of results from corresponding functions.

Rewrite the code to use simple functions to get the same results but using a multiprocessing library.
Time the execution of both realizations, explore the results,
what realization is more effective, why did you get a result like this.



Task 2

Requests using asyncio and aiohttp

Download all comments from a subreddit of your choice using URL: https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/comment/search/ .

As a result, store all comments in chronological order in JSON and dump them to a file.
For this task use asyncio and aiohttp libraries for making requests to Reddit API.



Task 3

Echo server with asyncio

Create a socket echo server which handles each connection using asyncio Tasks.
