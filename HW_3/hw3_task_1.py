# Task 1

# The greeting program.

# Make a program that has your name and the current day of the week stored as separate variables and then prints
# a message like this:

# "Good day <name>! <day> is a perfect day to learn some python."
# Note that  <name> and <day> are predefined variables in source code.

# An additional bonus will be to use different string formatting methods for constructing result string.
