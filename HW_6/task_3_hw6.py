# Task 3

# Extracting numbers.

# Make a list that contains all integers from 1 to 100, 
# then find all integers from the list that are divisible by 7 
# but not a multiple of 5, and store them in a separate list. 
# Finally, print the list.

# Constraint: use only while loop for iteration
